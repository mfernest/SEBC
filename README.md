# <center>SEBC Courseware

This repository holds the course materials for Cloudera's Services
Enablement Boot Camp (SEBC). Once you are added as a collaborator,
fork this repo. Please be careful not to change anything in the
master copy of this repo.

On your forked copy, make the following changes:
* Under `Settings -> Collaborators`, edit your list. Keep your
classmates and instructors. Remove anyone else.
* Under `Settings -> Options`, find the `Features` box. Enable `Issues`.
* Click the `Issues` tab and then the `Milestones button`. Create the milestones `Labs` and `Challenges`
* Click the `Labels` button and edit them as follows:
    * Change 'bug' to 'broken'
    * Change 'duplicate' to 'started'
    * Change 'enhancement' to 'review'
    * Change 'help wanted' to 'completed'
    * Leave 'invalid' as is
    * Leave 'question' as is
    * Change 'wontfix' to 'incomplete' and set color to yellow (`#fbca04`).
* Click the `Milestones` button and two milestones: `Labs` and `Challenges`

We'll use these elements to mark the progress and evaluation of your course work.

If you want to change or correct something in the master repo,
please consult with your instructor(s) first.

When the course is completed, your repo effectively stands as a
your record of completed assignments, warts and all! You'll be able
to review your work once class is done, repeat assignments if you
wish, replace ok links with better links, you name it! Think of
this material as a base for an ongoing, self-guided education.
